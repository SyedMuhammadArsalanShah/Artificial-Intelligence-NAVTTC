It seems like you want me to find a pattern or answer from the given data about Nouman Ali Khan's lectures series "Akhri Mojza" (Last Lesson).

From the given data, I can see that all the timestamps are close to each other and have a range of 5-10 seconds. The names also seem to be the same ("VID.mp4.mp3") for each row.

However, if I look at the "text" column, I notice that there is no coherent information provided in these rows. Instead, it seems like some repetitive phrases are repeated multiple times with slight variations:

* "What is the meaning of history?" (3 times)
* "This is the meaning of history." (3 times)

Considering this pattern, if you ask me a question related to the meaning of history or the importance of learning from past experiences, I might be able to provide an answer based on my general knowledge.

But, please note that without more context or information about Nouman Ali Khan's lectures series "Akhri Mojza", it would be challenging for me to provide a precise or detailed answer.
