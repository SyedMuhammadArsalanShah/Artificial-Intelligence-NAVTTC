The last and final episode of Aakhri Mojza is coming soon on the 6th of March, 2024, just before Ramadan in Shah Allah. It will be an almost two hour special session by Ustad Nurman. Here is a short preview from the final episode, episode 61 of Aakhri Mojza. Finding Nemo is a scene in the movie that he was not able to meet his son Nemo. So, he is sitting on a couch, and he is sitting on the couch. Is that the right word? Is that the right word? He is on a third all. I don't know what his call is. Okay, a third all. He is sitting on the couch and saying, what happened to him? So, he doesn't have to listen to the story. He goes and listens to someone else. He goes and listens to Dolphins again. Dolphins, Shalang, Ma'ar, and the first time he listens to the story. First, he goes and reaches Australia, and then he is trapped in the air. Right? So, he has one person and he has one person and he has three people. He has four people. But when he has one person and has one person, he has one person and he has five minutes. In the movie, he didn't see that he has one person and has five minutes. Then he has three people and has five minutes of recording. Then he reached the next place. There are a lot of scenes in the middle. He was talking to the family after a long time. You all stay here. I will meet Haroon and meet Haroon. I won't talk to Haroon. I will be sitting with him. I will be eating and then I will get a mission. I will be there with the security guard. Is that all in the Quran? What is the next scene? You have reached. You have reached inside the palace. So, to understand this scene, I want you to use your imagination. The next scene."}
