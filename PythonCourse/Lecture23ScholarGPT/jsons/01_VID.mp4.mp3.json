The last and final episode of Aakhri Mojza is coming soon on 6th March. 2224, just before Ramadan inshaAllah. It will be in almost 2 hour special session by Usdad Nurman. Here is a short preview from the final episode episode 61 of Aakhri Mojza. This study was started today and through the contract of the Full Quran People say we talk about science they talk about practicality Scientists once talk about psychological Fine Language There is no spiritual or spiritual value in this book. There are many things that are needed in this book. There are children talking about this book. There are youths and there are also boys. There are many people talking about this book. What does our religion say about this book? Allah says that this is the book of Islam. This is the book of Islam, religion, religion. This is the wrong thing. If a science is talking about science, what is the importance of science? Science is the importance of science. What is the importance of history? What is the meaning of history? The way the Lord has created this message. The meaning of science is the knowledge of science. There is no knowledge of science that is not in the form of science. There is no knowledge of science. When a person is talking about something in the form of a God, then Allah says that this is the meaning of history. This is the meaning of history. This is the meaning of history. No, whatever psychology you learn, you can keep all the religions. Whatever science teaches you, you can keep all the religions. Whatever you learn, you can keep all the religions. There is no God, there is no God, there is no God. Everyone is talking about the meaning of history. So, this is the meaning of history. This is the meaning of history. The word of the Quran is in the name of the work. This is the meaning of history. Allah says that this is not the meaning of history. Okay. Today, I have given my opinion. And the entire thing I have kept in front of you, I have made this notes. In 2004, in 2005, I was raised in the year 19. And when I made this notes, I was talking about the meaning of history. What do I think about the meaning of the Quran? I am talking about the meaning of history. I am talking about the meaning of the Quran. So, I started talking about the meaning of the Quran. But the meaning of history has changed. And finally, I realized that the meaning of the Quran is not reached by a person. It is not for a person. A person can only reach a person who is the beauty of Allah's beauty, the beauty of his beauty, the beauty of his beauty, the beauty of his beauty, the beauty of his beauty, and the beauty of his beauty, he can be seen in his eyes. This is the meaning of history. But the meaning of the Quran is like this. It was selected by the Prophet over the first years. While charging for completing the past year, it took time to be a completeLord, and we did a real thing, the character that was assembled on the development of the commandments of the whole of India. We have spoken about the values of all\ud83e\udd14 and the journey in a decent way. Does that means that the turnip of the world can never end\u840c or become strong in the Season of 3rd \u0419\u03c0\u0e32\u0e07\u062a\u0637 named It might think this is the full energy of the star and the light the whole universe could never bepside let's get along with this Quran This Surah is only after Carl's initialized verses tract Iraqi f\u00edsica and other homes in\u9055ities.
